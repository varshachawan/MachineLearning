1b) The Error rate for each Ensemble classifier is printed on the screen in the program.
It is observed that ,the error rate is more for single classifier, on bagging the errror rate is 
decreased for ensemble of 10 classifier , where as it increases slightly for ensemble of 50 and 100
classifers , but still it performs better than base model.

(As we are selecting random training data, the error rate is slighly different everytime we run the program)

2b)The Error rate for each Ensemble classifier is printed on the screen in the program.
It is observed that ,the error rate is more for single classifier, on applying boosting 
for ensemble of 10 classifier the errorrate reduces but later on remains constant.
